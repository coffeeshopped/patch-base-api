<p>Function that generates a byte array from a sequence of one or more MIDI messages.</p>
<p>rule:
[&quot;&gt;&quot;, [[SinglePatchTruss.Core.FromMidiFn]], [[ByteTransform]]...]</p>
<p>Creates a FromMidiFn using the second array element (after the &quot;&gt;&quot;), then feeds the output of that FromMidiFn to a series of one or more [[ByteTransform]]s in succession to generate the final</p>
<p>rule:
[[ByteTransform]]</p>
<p>A FromMidiFn is created that first flattens all the bytes of the incoming MIDI messages into a single byte array, then feeds that array into the parsed ByteTransform.</p>
<p>rule:
[[[SinglePatchTruss.Core.FromMidiFn]]]</p>
<p>Creates a single FromMidiFn that feeds MIDI messages into each of the individual FromMidiFn's in the array, and takes all of the outputs and concatenates them as a single byte array.</p>
